# z3mu

**z3mu** aims to emulate the Z3 by wiring each of its ~2,000 relays in a custom circuit simulator.

## Background

Konrad Zuse's Z3 was an electromechanical computer built in 1941 capable of

- reading programs from punched tape,
- 22-bit floating-point calculation (`add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`, `sqrt`),
- storing 64 numbers in memory, and
- input/output using a special terminal.

While it notably lacks a conditional branch instruction, the Z3 is technically Turing complete. Therefore it is often credited as the world's first computer.
